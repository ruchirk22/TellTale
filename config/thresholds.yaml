# TellTale Scoring Weights & Risk Thresholds

# --- Scoring Weights ---
# How much each score contributes to the final probability (must sum to 1.0)
weights:
  prosody_abnormality: 0.25
  pause_abnormality: 0.20
  disfluency_absence: 0.25
  ai_content_probability: 0.20
  rate_consistency: 0.10

# --- Risk Level Thresholds ---
# The boundaries for the final probability
risk_levels:
  HIGH: 0.75          # 75% and above
  MEDIUM-HIGH: 0.60   # 60% - 74.9%
  MEDIUM: 0.45        # 45% - 59.9%
  LOW-MEDIUM: 0.30    # 30% - 44.9%
  # Anything below LOW-MEDIUM is "LOW"

# --- Feature Thresholds (for score calculation) ---
# These are the "magic numbers" used in _calculate_detection_scores
# Tuned based on the Master Prompt's algorithms.

prosody:
  # Pitch Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  pitch_cv_suspicious: 0.15   # Below this is 0.8 susp.
  pitch_cv_somewhat: 0.25     # Below this is 0.4 susp.
  
  # Monotonicity
  monotonicity_suspicious: 0.7  # Above this is 0.9 susp.
  monotonicity_somewhat: 0.5    # Above this is 0.5 susp.

pause:
  # Micropause Count
  micropause_suspicious: 3      # Below this is 0.8 susp.
  micropause_somewhat: 7      # Below this is 0.4 susp.
  
  # Pause Standard Deviation
  pause_std_suspicious: 0.1     # Below this is 0.7 susp.

disfluency:
  # Disfluency "Naturalness" Score (from 0-100)
  # These are the cutoffs for the 'disfluency_absence' score
  score_suspicious_1: 10      # Below this = 0.9 absence score
  score_suspicious_2: 20      # Below this = 0.7 absence score
  score_suspicious_3: 40      # Below this = 0.3 absence score

ai_content:
  # (This is handled by the ai_content_detector module itself)
